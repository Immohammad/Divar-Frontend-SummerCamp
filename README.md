This exam was held in two stages. The first stage was about the basic concepts of programming. The second stage ,that was more important, included a problem that had to be implemented with JavaScript; The final implementation of this section is [here](https://divar-summercamp-solution.netlify.app/).<br/>
The detailed version of the explanation is found in `.pdf` files, which is written in Persian.

## Stages Explanation
The first stage was common between front-end and software engineering applicants; It had 4 questions that frontend applicants had to answer 3 of them in 2 hours with any language. I solved these questions with c++. for running and editing codes you can use websites (like ideone) or installing an IDE and gnu-gcc.<br/>

The second stage was for frontend applicants. in this stage we had three `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files and we had to meet the requirements and build a dot-line game by editing the `.js` file. As mentioned above, the final implementation of this stage is available on https://divar-summercamp-solution.netlify.app/. to editing and run codes you need a text editor and a browser.
